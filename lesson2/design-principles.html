            <h3>Visual hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>Church of JesusChrist Website</h4>
            <h4><a target="blank_" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">churchofjesuschrist.org</a></h4>
            <img  src="churchofjesuschrist.jpg" alt="church of jesuschrist">
            <p>The church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints’ website makes a great work in showing its purpose. 
                This purpose is achieved at making it visual understable with its hierarchy. We can find 
                the name of the church, at the top-left of the website we can find a big picture of Jesus Christ.
                 the first part watched is the top-left, so the attention is brought to Jesus Christ.
                  Then we have some pictures and as we are getting far from the first one, every picture left is getting
                   small. So, this web makes a good job with visual hierarchy.</p>

            <h3>contrast</h3>
            <h4>Apple</h4>
            <h4><a target="blank_" href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a></h4>
            <img  src="apple.jpg" alt="apple">
            <p>The apple website is very interesting to learn design. At the beginning of the web we can see the navigation
                 bar showing us the entire catalog of Apple products followed by a minimalist design with the news in its 
                 most recent products. Something that also stands out is contrast and how this helps make the page visually 
                 appealing to the customer. Use black and white to create contrast in your ad for the new iPhone. In this way 
                 the information is perfectly differentiated to make it easier to understand and read.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <h4>Twitch</h4>
            <h4><a target="blank_" href="https://www.twitch.tv">twitch.tv</a></h4>
            <img  src="twitch.jpg" alt="twitch">
            <p>The twitch website does a great job with alignment. The design of the twitch page is similar to that of 
                youtube or amazon. The content of the page is not always the same since it consists of streaming and every
                 time the page loads again it will show different streaming and videos. This type of page can be confusing
                  and chaotic due to the large amount of content it displays. And since the profits of the page consist of 
                  the content you consume, they must do a good job of lining up so that it is visually understood and well 
                  visualized.</p>
